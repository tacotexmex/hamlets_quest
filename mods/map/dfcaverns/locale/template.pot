"A meal made from the admixture of two ingredients, biscuits keep well but "

msgid ""
"Stews mix three ingredients together. They're more wholesome than biscuits, "

"Cave moss is technically a form of mold, but fortunately a relatively benign "
"one given its ubiquity. Its fibers form a tough but springy mat over the "
"surface of any organic-rich soil that accumulates deep underground."
msgstr ""

#: doc.lua:19
msgid ""
"Cave moss has no known uses. It dies when exposed to bright light sources."
msgstr ""

#: doc.lua:20
msgid ""
"Floor fungus produces a thin, slick film that spreads through the cracks of "
"broken rock. Its ability to subsist on the tiniest traces of nutrients means "
"it's found in relatively harsh underground environments."
msgstr ""

#: doc.lua:21
msgid ""
"Floor fungus has no known uses. It can penetrate deeply into cobblestone "
"constructions if an infestation gets hold, but it is difficult to transport "
"and is inhibited by light so it hasn't spread beyond the deep caverns."
msgstr ""

#: doc.lua:23
msgid ""
"Glistening strings of silk hang from the ceilings of some of the larger "
"caverns, lit by the millions of tiny bioluminescent worms that spun them. "
"Glow worms prey on the insects they lure and entangle with their faux starry "
"sky - and sometimes the occasional bat or other larger flying beast."
msgstr ""

#: doc.lua:24
msgid ""
"Glow worms can be harvested and used as a source of light but they die when "
"exposed to light significantly brighter than themselves or when immersed in "
"water. A colony of glow worms hung in a hospitable environment will undergo "
"a modest amount of growth, allowing it to be divided and propagated."
msgstr ""

#: doc.lua:28
msgid "Whatever this fungus was in life, it is now dead."
msgstr ""

#: doc.lua:29
msgid ""
"Dead fungus quickly decays into an unrecognizable mess. It can be used as "
"weak fuel or terrible decor."

#: doc.lua:31
msgid ""
"A species of lavender mushroom ubiquitous in caves that is most notable for "
"the soft bioluminescence it produces."
msgstr ""

#: doc.lua:32
msgid ""
"This mushroom is inedible but continues producing modest levels of light "
"long after it's picked."
msgstr ""

#: doc.lua:34
msgid ""
"Cave wheat is literally a breed of grain-producing grass that somehow lost "
"its ability to photosynthesize and adapted to a more fungal style of life."
msgstr ""

#: doc.lua:35
msgid ""
"Like its surface cousin, cave wheat produces grain that can be ground into a "
"form of flour."
msgstr ""

msgid "Cave wheat seed ground into a powder suitable for cooking."
msgstr ""

#: doc.lua:37
msgid ""
"When baked alone it forms an edible bread, but it combines well with other "

msgstr ""

#: doc.lua:38
msgid ""
"Bread baked from cave wheat flour is tough and durable. A useful ration for "
"long expeditions."
msgstr ""

msgid "It's not tasty, but it keeps you going."

#: doc.lua:41
msgid ""
"The distinctive midnight-blue caps of these mushrooms are inverted, exposing "

"Dimple cups can be dried, ground, and processed to extract a deep blue dye."
msgstr ""

"Pig tails are a fibrous fungal growth that's most notable for its twisting "
"stalks. In a mature stand of pig tails the helical stalks intertwine into a "
"dense mesh."

"A crafting item that can be woven into textiles and other similar items."

"Plump helmets are a thick, fleshy mushroom that's edible picked straight "
"from the ground. They form a staple diet for both lost cave explorers and "
"the fauna that preys on them."
msgstr ""

#: doc.lua:50
msgid ""
"While they can be eaten fresh, they can be monotonous fare and are perhaps "
"better appreciated as part of a more complex prepared dish."
msgstr ""

#: doc.lua:52
msgid ""
"A rare breed of fungus from deep underground that produces a bushy cluster "
"of rumpled gray 'blades'. The biological function of these blades is not "
"known, as quarry bushes reproduce via hard-shelled nodules that grow down at "
"the blade's base."
msgstr ""

#: doc.lua:53
msgid ""
"Quarry bush leaves and nodules (called 'rock nuts') can be harvested and are "
"edible with processing."
msgstr ""

#: doc.lua:54
msgid ""
"The dried blades of a quarry bush add a welcome zing to recipes containing "
"otherwise-bland subterranean foodstuffs, but they're too spicy to be eaten "
"on their own."
msgstr ""

#: doc.lua:55
msgid "Quarry bush leaves can be used as an ingredient in foodstuffs."
msgstr ""

#: doc.lua:57
msgid ""
"Sweet pods grow in rich soil, and once they reach maturity they draw that "
"supply of nutrients up to concentrate it in their fruiting bodies. They turn "
"bright red when ripe and can be processed in a variety of ways to extract "
"the sugars they contain."
msgstr ""

#: doc.lua:60
msgid "When milled, sweet pods produce a granular sugary substance."

msgid ""
"The dense black wood of these mushrooms is heavy and hard to work with, and "
"has few remarkable properties."
msgstr ""

#: doc.lua:73
msgid ""
"Aside from the artistic applications of its particularly dark color, black "
"cap wood is a long-burning fuel source that's as good as coal for some "
"applications."
msgstr ""

#: doc.lua:75
msgid ""
"Blood thorns are the most vicious of underground flora, as befits their "
"harsh environments. Found only in hot, dry caverns with sandy soil far from "
"the surface world's organic bounty, blood thorns seek to supplement their "
"nutrient supply with wickedly barbed hollow spines that actively drain "
"fluids from whatever stray plant or creature they might impale."
msgstr ""

#: doc.lua:76
msgid ""
"When harvested, the central stalk of a blood thorn can be cut into planks "
"and used as wood. It has a purple-red hue that may or may not appeal, "
"depending on one's artistic tastes."
msgstr ""

#: doc.lua:77
msgid ""
"The spikes of a blood thorn can actually remain living long after they're "
"severed from their parent stalk, a testament to their tenacity. As long as "
"they remain alive they will continue to actively drain anything they "
"puncture, though they don't grow."
msgstr ""

#: doc.lua:78
msgid ""
"Living blood thorn spikes remain harmful to creatures that touch them. If "
"killed by bright light, they cause only passive damage to creatures that "
"fall on them (as one would expect from an enormous spike)."
msgstr ""

#: doc.lua:80
msgid ""
"Thin, irregular layers of spore-producing 'shelves' surround the strong "
"central stalk of the mighty Fungiwood."
msgstr ""

#: doc.lua:81
msgid ""
"Fungiwood stalk is strong and very fine-grained, making smooth yellow-tinted "
"lumber when cut. Fungiwood shelf is too fragile to be much use as anything "
"other than fuel."
msgstr ""

#: doc.lua:83
msgid ""
"Massive but squat, mature goblin cap mushrooms are the size of small "
"cottages."
msgstr ""

#: doc.lua:84
msgid ""
"Goblin cap stem and cap material can be cut into wood of two different hues, "
"a subdued cream and a bright orange-red."
msgstr ""

#: doc.lua:86
msgid ""
"Nether caps have an unusual biochemistry that allows them to somehow subsist "
"on ambient heat, in violation of all known laws of thermodynamics. They grow "
"deep underground in frigid, icy caverns that should by all rights be "
"volcanic."
msgstr ""

#: doc.lua:87
msgid ""
"Nether cap wood, in addition to being a beautiful blue hue, retains the odd "
"heat-draining ability of living nether caps and is able to quickly freeze "
"nearby water solid."
msgstr ""

#: doc.lua:89
msgid ""
"Spore trees have a sturdy 'trunk' that supports a large spongy mesh of "
"branching fibers, with embedded fruiting bodies that produce a copious "
"amount of spores that gently rain down around the spore tree's base."
msgstr ""

#: doc.lua:90
msgid ""
"Spore tree trunks can be cut into pale woody planks. The branching fibers "
"and fruiting bodies are only useful as fuel."

msgstr ""

"Tunnel tubes are hollow, curved fungal growths that support a fruiting body."
msgstr ""

#: doc.lua:97
msgid ""
"The trunk of a tunnel tube can be cut and processed to produce plywood-like "
"material. The fruiting body accumulates high-energy compounds that, when "
"ignited, produce a vigorous detonation - a unique adaptation for spreading "
"tunnel tube spawn through the still cavern air."
