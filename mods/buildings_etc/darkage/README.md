# DarkAge Mod for Minetest
Original mod by Master Gollum 
Modified by addi. 

Contains code from CragiDavi and HybridDog

## Introduction:
  This mod adds a few new blocks that allows to create new buildings in a
  pre industrial landscape. Of course, feel free to use them in any other 
  construction :P

  It also provides more layers of stones. I tried not to turn mining in
  a rainbow, so don't expect to find them easily. There are two kinds of
  materials, stones, that spawns in layers at different deep and clay
  like materials (silt and mud) that you will find in water places.
  Silt and Mud are more easy to find than stone layers, but if you find
  one it will be a real mine, with all probability with hundreds of blocks.

  I used mainly 4 square recipes to avoid collisions with other MODs, 
  anyway I have not checked all them, so it is possible that another 
  person is already using one or more of this combinations.

  I also used Desert Sand and Desert Stone, because they almost are not
  used in the default version. Probably I will change this recipes in 
  next releases.

## BUILDING NODES

### Adobe: 
Sand and Clay mixture with Straw to build houses or walls.
Used from historical times, one of the first bricks 
invented. I have to improve this texture, it is ugly :P

     CRAFT -> 4
     [Sand] [Sand]
     [Clay Lump] [Straw]


### Basalt:
A darken version of the default Stone
  
     COOKING
     [Basalt Rubble]


### Basalt Rubble:
A darken version of the default Cobble.
  
     CRAFT -> 4
     [Cobble] [Cobble]
     [Coal Lump] [Coal Lump]


### Chalk:
A soft, white and porous sedimentary rock. It becomes
Chalk Powder when dug. Can't be craft, only found as stratum.


### Chalk Powder:
Pile of chalk from digging Chalk stones. Can
be used to prepare plaster. See Cobblestone with Plaster.


### Cobblestone with Plaster:
Cobbles where has been applied a
layer of white plaster.
When dug it lost the plaster layer!

     CRAFT -> 2
     [Cobblestone] [Chalk Powder]
     [Cobblestone] [Chalk Powder]


### Dark Dirt: 
A darken version of the Dirt where the grass doesn't
grown, perfect for create a path in a forest. I was using
Gravel, but the noise walking was annoying to me (like
walking over iron coal with the nude feet :P), for this I
created this node.

     CRAFT -> 4
     [Dirt] [Dirt]
     [Gravel] [Gravel]


### Desert Iron Ore:
I know that others MODs add ores to the 
Desert Stones, mine also does it, but just Iron, I supposed
the red color is because of the iron, so it goes with more
high probability than regular Stones and it doesn't add
Coal to them. It will not be a lot so you can keep it with
another MOD that does the same or just comment the lines that
does it.


### Dry Leaves:
Just a cube of Leaves toasted :P Well I found the
Leaves are not useful so I thought to turn them into Straw, ok
it is not the same, but well, why not? Just dry them in a
Furnace and then put together to create the Straw

     COOKING
     [Leaves]


### Gneiss:
High grade metamorphic rock formed from Schist, very
common, and used in construction. It sometimes brakes in
Gneiss Rubble when being dug.

     COOKING

### Gneiss Rubble:
Cobble version of the gneiss.
  
     From dig gneiss


### Mud:
Mixture of water and some combination of soil, silt, and
clay. Used for build houses, specially in desert regions.
It brakes in 4 Mud Lumps when dug.

     CRAFT -> 3

     [Clay Lump] [Silt Lump]

     CRAFT -> 1
     [Mud Lump] [Mud Lump]
     [Mud Lump] [Mud Lump]


### Old Red Sandstone:
A light red sandstone, in fact it's
sandstone with iron that gives it this color.

     CRAFT -> 4
     [Sandstone] [Sandstone]
     [Iron Lump] [Sandstone]

     COOKING

     COOKING

### Desert Stone:
 Just the default block, it can be obtained now
 from Desert Sand. The idea is that Desert Sand is stonier
 than regular Sand, so it takes less to create a Desert
 Stone than a Sandstone.

##FURNITURE NODES
Just started so they are few ones

### Box:
A more smaller container than the Chest, but it requires
less wood. As cheep as 4 woods and have 16 slots. The craft
is a little weird but I think it makes sense and avoids
collision with the recipe of Hardwood of the MOD 
building_blocks.
