# Minetest Game Internationalization Mod
MTG 0.5.0-dev (2017-08-28), License: MIT (code), CC 0 (translations)

## Description
A Minetest mod adding translations to the default game of Minetest. You just have to install the
[intllib](https://github.com/minetest-mods/intllib/) mod and enable both in your world and all item
descriptions will be translated into your system's language (or language set in your Minetest
settings), but of course only as long your language is supported.

## Help Translating
YOU can help to translate the strings to your language easily on
[Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/minetest/mtg_i18n). It's sometimes a bit slow, because
it is the free, hosted version for open-source projects and is a bit overloaded. Using the "Zen-mode" can
help here: There you can see and translate all strings at once, and you don't have to reload the page
for every translation.

If you go on a long journey without having internet access, or you just prefer translating offline, you can
use [Poedit](https://poedit.net/) to translate the PO-files in the `locale` directory in this mod and create
a pull request on this repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/minetest-mods/mtg_i18n).
